<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![dmap-screenshot](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/454864152486477825/977821349877809192/Screenshot_20220521-222728_Discord.png)

Whether I'm working on HackTheBox challenges, or require a convenient way to scan a domain while I'm on the road, I always have access to Discord. The PoC of this project was started a few years ago, and this time a full-fledged environment will be available to all who need it. DMap intends to offer a convenient environment for scanning over a VPN connection, such as HackTheBox, remote enterprise, or CTF connections. Some functionality for creating a VPN connection to the device in order to scan local networks is in the works, but may be a bit delayed.

Why use DMap:
* Hands-on examples are more effective in teaching environments like school clubs, where students can follow along with a presenter in chat
* Simple scans can be handled in a few seconds from a mobile device or in any browser without requiring you to boot up your hacking machine
* Utilize MAC changing, IP rotation, and a sandboxed environment without effort

### Built With

Obviously, the two major components this project utilizes are Nmap and Discord's API. A few different modules and frameworks will also be included to handle VPN connections, different kinds of scanning and recon actions, and other security-related functions; this list will grow as the program does.

* [Nmap](https://nmap.org/)
* [Discord's Python API](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html)
* [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/)
* [PwnTools](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Words of Warning

If you plan on only using this solution in another person's server, feel free to skip this bit. If you'd like to host a free-running server for your own use, please heed the following advice. **Host this solution in a sandboxed environment, or on a machine/network that you have no personal stake in**. I cannot stress operational security enough in an environment where there are built-in security vulnerabilities; please use this software at your own discretion (and don't sue me if someone manages to run `os.system("rm -rf /")` on your un-hardened machine).


### Installation & Setup

When I automate the setup process, I'll add further instruction for installation and setup. For now, you'll just have to work it out on your own or use this on a Discord server.

## Usage

This space will be filled with examples of usage as the application is built and tested. For now, I appreciate your patience and look forward to making scanning easier for you in the near future!
